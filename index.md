# My Project Title

Welcome! This site showcases three parts of my project:

---

## ðŸš€ Part 1: Aerial Landing

![Aerial Landing](assets/robora.png)

A control framework for safe multirotor landings on inclined or dynamic platforms.  
Explores MPC, CLFs, and safety-critical reinforcement learning.

---

## ðŸŒŠ Part 2: USV Wave Modeling

![Wave Modeling](assets/robora.png)

We model surface wave dynamics to anticipate disturbances and enable real-time adaptation.  
Includes wave prediction using Gaussian Processes and online learning.

---

## ðŸ¤– Part 3: Multi-Agent Coordination

Two robots cooperate to share goals and adapt behavior using distributed model predictive control.  
We explore strategies for safe and robust coordination under uncertainty.
