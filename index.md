We present a **computationaly efficient learning-based algorithm** for **tiny multirotors** under aerodynamic disturbances.

This project is based on two recent papers:

- **Tiny Learning-Based MPC for Multirotors: Solver-Aware Learning for Efficient Embedded Predictive Control**  
  [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23634)

- **A Computationally Efficient Learning-Based MPC for Multirotors Under Aerodynamic Disturbances**  
  [IEEE link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557089)

### üß≠ Motivation

Tiny UAVs must navigate cluttered environments and handle aerodynamic drag, propwash, and wind ‚Äî all on minimal compute. Our work targets:

- **Embedded efficiency**: Optimizing for onboard solvers with low runtime and memory overhead
- **Disturbance robustness**: Learning dynamics-aware policies resilient to aerodynamic effects

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Approach Summary

#### Learning-Based Dynamics Modeling

We construct **data-driven models** that capture multirotor dynamics and external disturbances (like drag) via supervised learning from flight data.

#### Solver-Aware MPC

We use **differentiable programming** and **trajectory optimization-aware training** to learn dynamics models that are easy to optimize within MPC.

#### Real-Time Implementation

Our policies are deployed onboard resource-limited platforms using optimized CVXPY-based solvers and minimal memory.

### ‚úàÔ∏è Key Results

- **<10 ms solve time** for MPC problems onboard a Teensy 4.0
- Robust flight in presence of **significant drag**
- Trajectory tracking in cluttered environments
- Learning methods that are compatible with **real-time solvers**
